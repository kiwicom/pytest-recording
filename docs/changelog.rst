Changed

- Default cassette (usually named as the test function name) always exists. This changes the behavior in two ways.
  Firstly, recording will happen only to the default cassette and will not happen to any cassette passed as an argument to ``pytest.mark.vcr``
  Secondly, it will allow "shared" + "specific" usage pattern, when the default cassette contains data relevant only to
  the specific test and the custom one contains shared data, which is currently only possible with specifying full paths
  to both cassettes in ``pytest.mark.vcr``.
