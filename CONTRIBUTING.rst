Submitting Pull Requests
-----------------------

#. Fork the repository.
#. Enable and install `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`_ to ensure style-guides and code checks are followed.
#. Target the ``master`` branch.
#. Follow **PEP-8** for naming and `black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ for formatting.
#. Tests are run using ``tox``::

    tox -e py37

   The test environments above are usually enough to cover most cases locally.

#. Write an entry to `changelog.rst <https://github.com/kiwicom/pytest-recording/blob/master/docs/changelog.rst>`_
#. Format your commit message according to the Conventional Commits `specification <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/>`_

If you have troubles with installing ``pycurl`` with ``tox``, you could try to pass ``CPPFLAGS`` and ``LDFLAGS``
with the ``tox`` command:

.. code:: bash

    $  CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" tox -p all

For each pull request, we aim to review it as soon as possible.
If you wait a few days without a reply, please feel free to ping the thread by adding a new comment.

At present the core developers are:

- Dmitry Dygalo (`@Stranger6667`_)
